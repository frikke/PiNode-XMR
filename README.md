# Quick Start Guide v6.24.01-Open-Build		
### This page is a quick overview to get you started. A complete and comprehensive manual showing all features can be found here at the Wiki: [Full Manual](https://github.com/shermand100/PiNodeXMR/wiki/Manual)

# Project Overview

PiNode-XMR is a completely free and open source suite of tools to help a user run their own Monero node with ease. PiNode-XMR was originally designed for use with single board computers (SBC) such as the Raspberry Pi, Pine64 or Odroid hardware to allow for very cheap node setup and minimal 24/7 running costs due to low power usage. We now support just about any ARM64 hardware too, so an old laptop, minipc or desktop!

PiNode-XMR can provide a Full or Pruned Monero Node and optional integration with tor/I2P along with many other tools such as your own block explorer, transaction pool viewer and connected peer lists. After setup, normal interaction is available through a built in web interface accessible from any device on your local network:

## Quick Start

### Hardware
PiNode-XMR is built ontop of Ubuntu Server LTS, so if it can run that it can run a node (2GB RAM recommended, 32/64bit compatible, 64bit allows for all features) . This allows for installation on many different devices.

A list of tested and supported hardware can be found here [PiNodeXMR Wiki: Hardware](https://github.com/shermand100/PiNodeXMR/wiki/Hardware)

Best value/performance as of Q1 2024 seems to be the Rock Pi 4.

Choose your device and storage, then download and write the Ubuntu Server LTS OS. There is no need for the GUI as PiNodeXMR will produce it's own interface later. Many devices also support USB boot as an alternative to MicroSD cards, performance and longevity is greatly increased if you can take the extra step.

Once you have your basic OS:

**Raspberry Pi** users can log in as usual with user 'pi' and password 'raspberry'

**Ubuntu users** should login with the default (usually it's username 'root' with password '1234') and create a new user called 'pinodexmr'. Once Ubuntu users have created 'pinodexmr' they should remain logged in as user 'root'.

Finally to install the PiNode-XMR project simply run the single line:

`wget -O â€“ install.pinodexmr.co.uk | bash`

And follow the menu prompts.



## Downloads
#### Download PiNode-XMR disk images 

Pre-configured disk images are available for the following devices:
* Raspberry Pi 3 (32-bit)
* Raspberry Pi 4 (64-bit)
* RockPro64 (64-bit)
* Rock64 (64-bit)
* Odroid XU4 / HC1 / HC2 (32-bit)

Note that 32-bit devices cannot run P2Pool

* Telegram group PiNode-XMR [t.me/PiNodeXMR](https://t.me/PiNodeXMR)

During install a debug file is generated at the path /home/pinodexmr/debug.log  Any errors from a failed install are passed to this file and may be helpful should you have a problem. Most commonly errors on first build are due to a dependency not being downloaded (server 404), the install command can be run multiple times.

I am slowly building a [FAQ page](https://github.com/shermand100/PiNodeXMR/wiki/FAQ)

*Hosting large image files such as the pre-sync'd version does come with it's costs. If you like the project or found the images helpful any contribution would be gratefully received:*
